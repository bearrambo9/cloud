# Cloud Remote Administration Platform ☁

Cloud is a Windows remote administration tool that is controlled through the browser. Cloud's intended usage is to remotely manage, monitor, and troubleshoot devices for educational or IT enterprise purposes. This tool is a project by me for a highschool tech competition.
